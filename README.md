# Imbalanced-Datasets
In this Repo, I will show how to go about working with class imbalance problems by employing different techniques.
1. Working with Credit Card Dataset that can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud

About the Dataset: This dataset contains unlabelled data i.e. the feautres( columns ) are anonymized and the data inside them is a result of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) of original feautres. Since, the feautres are anonymized, there is no scope of feautre engineering. PCA transformation ensures that these feautres are the best representative of the original dataset and there are no missing values to deal with.

We will be applying treebag to train our model before applying SMOTE and after applying SMOTE and see the results.
